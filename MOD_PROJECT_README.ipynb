    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to query the database and get the data needed to perform a statistical analysis and provide insight / suggestions to the business.  In this statistical analysis, perform hypothesis testing with both **null and alternative hypothesis** $H_0$ and $H_1$ respectively.\n",

    "1. A **_Jupyter Notebook_** containing any code you've written for this project. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project.\n",
    "2. An organized **README.md** file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository.\n",
    "3. A **_[Blog Post](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-welcome-blogging)_**.\n",
    "4. An **_\"Executive Summary\" PowerPoint Presentation_** that explains the hypothesis tests you ran, your findings, and their relevance to company stakeholders.  \n",
